  			<p>After 1.5 years of dedicated study, I have developed a deep understanding of all the main topics in Python. My skills encompass core programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms, along with advanced techniques such as decorators, generators, and context managers. I am proficient in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), enabling me to design and implement complex systems with reusable and maintainable code. I have repeatedly studied Python, each time delving deeper into its intricacies and broadening my expertise. My knowledge extends to a wide array of Python libraries, including NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning. Additionally, I have mastered web scraping with BeautifulSoup and Selenium, and web development with Django and Flask. This comprehensive understanding allows me to develop and deliver complete, working applications. Through this journey, I have not only gained theoretical knowledge but also practical experience, evidenced by the successful completion and deployment of multiple projects.</p>
